Inheritance :
base class type object can only access the base class member functions and the data members even though there is a virtual function 
this is for the normal class object   
    Ex : A object = b_object 

Virtual :
in case the base class function have virtual in it the derived class member fucntion having the 
override will be called or the function with same name as the virtual func name in the base class will be called 
this is for the ref and pointer objects of base class 
    Ex : A * ptr = &b_object        or       A & ref = *b_ptr
